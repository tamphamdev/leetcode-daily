# Daily LeetCode Challenge

Welcome to the Daily LeetCode Challenge repository! This repository is designed to help you improve your problem-solving skills by tackling a new LeetCode problem every day. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced coder, this challenge will provide you with a daily dose of coding practice.

## How It Works

- **Challenge**: Each day, a new LeetCode problem will be posted in the `challenges` directory. You can find problems for the entire month organized by date.

- **Solutions**: You are encouraged to solve the daily challenge on your own. After you have your solution, you can create a new file in the `solutions` directory named after the problem. Feel free to use any programming language of your choice.

- **Discussion**: Once you have solved the problem or are looking for help, you can participate in discussions. Use the GitHub Issues section to ask questions, share your solution, or provide feedback.

- **Contribute**: If you have a different approach or would like to improve an existing solution, please feel free to create a pull request. Contributions are highly appreciated!
